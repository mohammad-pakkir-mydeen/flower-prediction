Iris Flower Species Prediction Dataset
This dataset contains information about Iris flowers and can be used to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its characteristics.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 150 samples from three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Each sample has four features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
The dataset also includes a target variable indicating the Iris species (setosa, virginica, or versicolor).

Data Format
The data is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) format. The first line contains the column names, and each subsequent line represents a flower sample with its features and target variable separated by commas.

Using the Dataset
This dataset is commonly used for machine learning tasks, particularly in classification problems. You can use this data to train a model to predict the Iris species of a new flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.
